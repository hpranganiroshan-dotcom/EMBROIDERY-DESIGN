# How to Publish Your Embroidery Website

Congratulations! Your multi-page embroidery design website is fully built.

## 1. Viewing Your Website Locally
To see your website right now:
1. Open the folder `c:\Users\RANGA\EMBRODERY DESIGN` in File Explorer.
2. Double-click on `index.html`.
3. It will open in your default web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
4. You can navigate between Home, Gallery, About, and Contact pages just like a real website.

## 2. Publishing to the Internet (Free Options)

Since you don't have coding tools like Git installed, the easiest ways to publish are "Drag and Drop" services.

### Option A: Netlify Drop (Recommended)
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Open your File Explorer to `c:\Users\RANGA`.
3. Drag the entire `EMBRODERY DESIGN` folder onto the Netlify page where it says "Drag and drop your site folder here".
4. Wait a few seconds for it to upload.
5. Netlify will give you a live URL (e.g., `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`) that you can share with anyone!

### Option B: GitHub Pages (If you install Git later)
If you decide to install Git in the future:
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Push your `EMBRODERY DESIGN` folder to that repository.
3. Go to Repository Settings -> Pages -> Select 'main' branch -> Save.
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.

## 3. Customizing Your Content
- **Images**: Currently, the site uses placeholder images from Unsplash. To use your own embroidery images:
  - Save your images into the `images` folder.
  - Open the HTML files (`index.html`, `gallery.html`, etc.) in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
  - Replace the `src="..."` links with your file paths (e.g., `src="images/my-design.jpg"`).

- **Text**: You can edit the text in any HTML file to match your specific brand voice and details.

Enjoy your new website!
